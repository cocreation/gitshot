# GitShot 

Let's nurture GitShot to be the most ‚ö°Ô∏è, ‚ú® and ü§© GitHub client app ever. 

## We build it for you

Tons of GitHub clients exist, but none of them seems to match our expectation. We believe that dealing with issues should be:

‚ö°Ô∏è Just *fast* (we mean few seconds)

‚ú® Surprisingly easy (e.g. adding a screenshot to an issue)

ü§© Wow! (vs. bored to death)

If, like us, you share these belives, contribute our community by sharing with us your use cases and what you and your team is needing.

## Community guidelines

It seemed like a good idea to use GitShot to build GitShot. 

Feel free to open issues in this repo to tell us what you need. Please feel at home here and do what you would do with your own repo.

What we love:

‚ö°Ô∏è Less is more (aka. UX first)

ü§ì Focus on what you and your team need (vs. feature requests)

üëå Understand in depth (main use cases first)

## Download

[Download the latest release](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gitshot-github-issues-client/id1344912689?mt=8)

The app is paying to allow us dedicate sufficient time to make it outstanding. You know the feeling, right? 

If you wish to get "close to the beast" and provide extensive feedback, we would be glad to offer you the app for free. 
To do so, [drop us a line](mailto:gitshot@cocreation.studio) and tell us what project you work.

## Track improvments

On top of discussing your needs within issues, we will use [a milestone for each release](https://github.com/cocreation/gitshot/milestones). E.g. thanks to [v1.1.0](https://github.com/cocreation/gitshot/milestone/1) you will be able to follow what we've implemented for you within GitShot.
