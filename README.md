# GitShot 

Let's nurture GitShot to be the most ‚ö°Ô∏è, ‚ú® and ü§© GitHub client app ever. 

## We build it with/for you

Tons of GitHub clients exist, but none of them seem to match our expectations. We believe that dealing with issues should be:

‚ö°Ô∏è Just *fast* (we mean a few seconds)

‚ú® Surprisingly easy (e.g. adding a screenshot to an issue)

ü§© Wow! (vs. bored to death)

If, like us, you share these beliefs, contribute to our community by sharing your use cases and what you and your team need.

## Community guidelines

It seemed like a good idea to use GitShot to build GitShot. 

[Open issues in this repo](https://github.com/cocreation/gitshot/issues/new) to tell us what you need and provide feedback. Please feel at home here and do what you would do with your own repo.

What we love:

‚ö°Ô∏è Less is more (aka. UX first)

ü§ì Focus on what you and your team need (vs. feature requests)

üëå Understand in depth (main use cases first)

We will use [a milestone for each release announcement](https://github.com/cocreation/gitshot/milestones). E.g. thanks to [v1.1.0](https://github.com/cocreation/gitshot/milestone/1) you will be able to follow what we've implemented for you within GitShot.

Thanks! ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Download the app

[Download the latest release](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gitshot-github-issues-client/id1344912689?mt=8)

GitShot is a paid app to allow us to dedicate sufficient time to make it outstanding. You know the feeling, right? 

If you wish to get "close to the beast" and provide extensive feedback, we would be glad to offer you the app for free. 
To do so, [drop us a line](mailto:gitshot@cocreation.studio) and tell us what project you work.
